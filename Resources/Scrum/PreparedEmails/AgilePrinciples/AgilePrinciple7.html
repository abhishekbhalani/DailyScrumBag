<h3>Agile Manifesto Seventh Principle</h3>
<p>Working software is the primary measure of progress – Delivering functional software to the customer is the ultimate factor that measures progress.</p>
<p><i>The Twelve Principles are the guiding principles for the methodologies that are included under the title “The Agile Movement.” They describe a culture in which change is welcome, and the customer is the focus of the work. They also demonstrate the movement’s intent as described by Alistair Cockburn, one of the signatories to the Agile Manifesto, which is to bring development into alignment with business needs.</i></p>
