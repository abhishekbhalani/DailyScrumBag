<h3>Scrum Theory</h3>
<p>Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory, or empiricism. Empiricism asserts that
        knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known. Scrum
        employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk. </p>
<p>Three pillars uphold every implementation of empirical process control: 
    <ul>
        <li>transparency</li>
        <li>inspection</li>
        <li>adaptation</li>
    </ul>
</p>
