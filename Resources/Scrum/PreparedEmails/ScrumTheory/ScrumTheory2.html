<h3>Scrum Theory - Transparency</h3>
<p>Significant aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome.
        Transparency requires those aspects be defined by a common standard so observers share a
        common understanding of what is being seen.</p>
<p>Examples:
    <ul>
        <li>A common language referring to the process must be shared by all participants.</li>
        <li>Those performing the work and those inspecting the resulting increment must share a
                common definition of “Done”.</li>
    </ul>
