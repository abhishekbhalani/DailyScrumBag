<h3>The Agile Scrum Events - Sprint Retrospective</h3>
<p>The Scrum Master encourages the Scrum Team to improve, within the Scrum process
    framework, its development process and practices to make it more effective and enjoyable for
    the next Sprint. During each Sprint Retrospective, the Scrum Team plans ways to increase
    product quality by improving work processes or adapting the definition of “Done”, if appropriate
    and not in conflict with product or organizational standards.</p>
