<h3>The Agile Scrum Events - Cancelling a Sprint</h3>
<p>A Sprint can be cancelled before the Sprint time-box is over. Only the Product Owner has the
    authority to cancel the Sprint, although he or she may do so under influence from the
    stakeholders, the Development Team, or the Scrum Master.</p>
<p>A Sprint would be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. This might occur if the
    company changes direction or if market or technology conditions change. In general, a Sprint
    should be cancelled if it no longer makes sense given the circumstances. But, due to the short
    duration of Sprints, cancellation rarely makes sense.</p>
