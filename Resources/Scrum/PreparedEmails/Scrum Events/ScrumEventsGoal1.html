<h3>The Agile Scrum Events - Sprint Goal</h3>
<p>The Sprint Goal is an objective set for the Sprint that can be met through the implementation of
    Product Backlog. It provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the
    Increment. It is created during the Sprint Planning meeting. The Sprint Goal gives the
    Development Team some flexibility regarding the functionality implemented within the Sprint.
    The selected Product Backlog items deliver one coherent function, which can be the Sprint Goal.
    The Sprint Goal can be any other coherence that causes the Development Team to work
    together rather than on separate initiatives.</p>
