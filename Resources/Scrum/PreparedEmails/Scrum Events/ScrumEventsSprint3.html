<h3>The Agile Scrum Events - The Sprint</h3>
<p>Each Sprint may be considered a project with no more than a one-month horizon. Like projects,
    Sprints are used to accomplish something. Each Sprint has a goal of what is to be built, a design
    and flexible plan that will guide building it, the work, and the resultant product increment.</p>
<p>Sprints are limited to one calendar month. When a Sprintâ€™s horizon is too long the definition of
    what is being built may change, complexity may rise, and risk may increase. Sprints enable
    predictability by ensuring inspection and adaptation of progress toward a Sprint Goal at least
    every calendar month. Sprints also limit risk to one calendar month of cost.</p>
