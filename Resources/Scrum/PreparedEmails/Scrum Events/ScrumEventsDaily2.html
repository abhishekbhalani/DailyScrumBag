<h3>The Agile Scrum Events - Daily Scrum</h3>
<p>The Development Team uses the Daily Scrum to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and to
    inspect how progress is trending toward completing the work in the Sprint Backlog. The Daily
    Scrum optimizes the probability that the Development Team will meet the Sprint Goal. Every
    day, the Development Team should understand how it intends to work together as a selforganizing
    team to accomplish the Sprint Goal and create the anticipated Increment by the end
    of the Sprint.
