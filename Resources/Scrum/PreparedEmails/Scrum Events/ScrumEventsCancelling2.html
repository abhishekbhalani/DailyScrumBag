<h3>The Agile Scrum Events - Cancelling a Sprint</h3>
<p>When a Sprint is cancelled, any completed and “Done” Product Backlog items are reviewed. If
    part of the work is potentially releasable, the Product Owner typically accepts it. All incomplete
    Product Backlog Items are re-estimated and put back on the Product Backlog. The work done on
    them depreciates quickly and must be frequently re-estimated.</p>
<p>Sprint cancellations consume resources, since everyone regroups in another Sprint Planning to
    start another Sprint. Sprint cancellations are often traumatic to the Scrum Team, and are very
    uncommon.
