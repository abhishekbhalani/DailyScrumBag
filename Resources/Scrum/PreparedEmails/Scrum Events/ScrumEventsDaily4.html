<h3>The Agile Scrum Events - Daily Scrum</h3>
<p>The Development Team or team members often meet immediately after the Daily Scrum for
    detailed discussions, or to adapt, or replan, the rest of the Sprintâ€™s work.</p>
<p>The Scrum Master ensures that the Development Team has the meeting, but the Development
    Team is responsible for conducting the Daily Scrum. The Scrum Master teaches the
    Development Team to keep the Daily Scrum within the 15-minute time-box.</p>
