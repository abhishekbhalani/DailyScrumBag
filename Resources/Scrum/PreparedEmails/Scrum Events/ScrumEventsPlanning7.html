<h3>The Agile Scrum Events - Sprint Planning</h3>
<p>The work to be performed in the Sprint is planned at the Sprint Planning. This plan is created by
    the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.</p>
<p>Sprint Planning is time-boxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter
    Sprints, the event is usually shorter. The Scrum Master ensures that the event takes place and
    that attendants understand its purpose. The Scrum Master teaches the Scrum Team to keep it
    within the time-box.</p>
<p>Sprint Planning answers the following:
    <ul>
        <li>What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?</li>
        <li>How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?</li>
    </ul>
