<h3>The Agile Scrum Events - Sprint Review</h3>
<p>A Sprint Review is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product
    Backlog if needed. During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate
    about what was done in the Sprint. Based on that and any changes to the Product Backlog
    during the Sprint, attendees collaborate on the next things that could be done to optimize value.
    This is an informal meeting, not a status meeting, and the presentation of the Increment is
    intended to elicit feedback and foster collaboration.</p>
