<h3>The Agile Scrum Events - Sprint Retrospective</h3>
<p>By the end of the Sprint Retrospective, the Scrum Team should have identified improvements
    that it will implement in the next Sprint. Implementing these improvements in the next Sprint is
    the adaptation to the inspection of the Scrum Team itself. Although improvements may be
    implemented at any time, the Sprint Retrospective provides a formal opportunity to focus on
    inspection and adaptation.</p>
