<h3>The Agile Scrum Events - Sprint Retrospective</h3>
<p>The Sprint Retrospective is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan
    for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint.</p>
<p>The Sprint Retrospective occurs after the Sprint Review and prior to the next Sprint Planning.
    This is at most a three-hour meeting for one-month Sprints. For shorter Sprints, the event is
    usually shorter. The Scrum Master ensures that the event takes place and that attendants
    understand its purpose.</p>
