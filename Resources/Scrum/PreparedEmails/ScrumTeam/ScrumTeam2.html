<h3>The Agile Scrum Team</h3>
<p>The team model in Scrum is designed to:
    <ul>
        <li>Optimize Flexibility</li>
        <li>Creativity</li>
        <li>Productivity</li>
    </ul>
    The Scrum Team has proven itself to be increasingly effective for all the earlier
stated uses, and any complex work.
</p>
<p>Scrum Teams deliver products iteratively and incrementally, maximizing opportunities for
    feedback. Incremental deliveries of “Done” product ensure a potentially useful version of
    working product is always available.
