<h3>The Development Team</h3>
<p>The Development Team consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially
    releasable Increment of “Done” product at the end of each Sprint. A “Done” increment is
    required at the Sprint Review. Only members of the Development Team create the Increment.</p>
<p>Development Teams are structured and empowered by the organization to organize and
    manage their own work. The resulting synergy optimizes the Development Team’s overall
    efficiency and effectiveness.
