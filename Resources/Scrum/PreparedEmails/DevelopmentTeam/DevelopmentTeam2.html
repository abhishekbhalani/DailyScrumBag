<h3>The Development Team</h3>
<p>Development Teams have the following characteristics:
<ul>
    <li>They are self-organizing. No one (not even the Scrum Master) tells the Development Team
        how to turn Product Backlog into Increments of potentially releasable functionality</li>
    <li>Development Teams are cross-functional, with all the skills as a team necessary to create a
        product Increment</li>
    <li>Scrum recognizes no titles for Development Team members, regardless of the work being
        performed by the person</li>
    <li>Scrum recognizes no sub-teams in the Development Team, regardless of domains that need
        to be addressed like testing, architecture, operations, or business analysis</li>
    <li>Individual Development Team members may have specialized skills and areas of focus, but
        accountability belongs to the Development Team as a whole</li>
</ul></p>
