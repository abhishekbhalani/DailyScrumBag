<h3>Development Team Size</h3>
<p>Optimal Development Team size is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to
    complete significant work within a Sprint. Fewer than three Development Team members
    decrease interaction and results in smaller productivity gains. Smaller Development Teams may
    encounter skill constraints during the Sprint, causing the Development Team to be unable to
    deliver a potentially releasable Increment. Having more than nine members requires too much
    coordination. Large Development Teams generate too much complexity for an empirical process
    to be useful. The Product Owner and Scrum Master roles are not included in this count unless
    they are also executing the work of the Sprint Backlog.</p>
