<h3>The Agile Scrum Artifacts - Product Backlog</h3>
<p>Higher ordered Product Backlog items are usually clearer and more detailed than lower ordered
    ones. More precise estimates are made based on the greater clarity and increased detail; the
    lower the order, the less detail. Product Backlog items that will occupy the Development Team
    for the upcoming Sprint are refined so that any one item can reasonably be “Done” within the
    Sprint time-box. Product Backlog items that can be “Done” by the Development Team within
    one Sprint are deemed “Ready” for selection in a Sprint Planning. Product Backlog items usually
    acquire this degree of transparency through the above described refining activities.</p>
