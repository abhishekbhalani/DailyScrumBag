<h3>The Agile Scrum Artifacts - Product Backlog</h3>
<h4>Monitoring Progress Toward Goals</h4>
<p>At any point in time, the total work remaining to reach a goal can be summed. The Product
    Owner tracks this total work remaining at least every Sprint Review. The Product Owner
    compares this amount with work remaining at previous Sprint Reviews to assess progress
    toward completing projected work by the desired time for the goal. This information is made
    transparent to all stakeholders.
