<h3>The Agile Scrum Artifacts - Product Backlog</h3>
<p>Product Backlog refinement is the act of adding detail, estimates, and order to items in the
    Product Backlog. This is an ongoing process in which the Product Owner and the Development
    Team collaborate on the details of Product Backlog items. During Product Backlog refinement,
    items are reviewed and revised. The Scrum Team decides how and when refinement is done.
    Refinement usually consumes no more than 10% of the capacity of the Development Team.
    However, Product Backlog items can be updated at any time by the Product Owner or at the
    Product Ownerâ€™s discretion</p>
