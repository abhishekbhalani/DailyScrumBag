<h3>The Agile Scrum Artifacts - Sprint Backlog</h3>
<p>The Sprint Backlog is a plan with enough detail that changes in progress can be understood in
    the Daily Scrum. The Development Team modifies the Sprint Backlog throughout the Sprint, and
    the Sprint Backlog emerges during the Sprint. This emergence occurs as the Development Team
    works through the plan and learns more about the work needed to achieve the Sprint Goal.
