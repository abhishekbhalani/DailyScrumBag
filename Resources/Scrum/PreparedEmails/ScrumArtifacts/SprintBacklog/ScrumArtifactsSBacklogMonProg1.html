<h3>The Agile Scrum Artifacts - Sprint Backlog</h3>
<h4>Monitoring Sprint Progress</h4>
<p>At any point in time in a Sprint, the total work remaining in the Sprint Backlog can be summed.
    The Development Team tracks this total work remaining at least for every Daily Scrum to project
    the likelihood of achieving the Sprint Goal. By tracking the remaining work throughout the
    Sprint, the Development Team can manage its progress.
