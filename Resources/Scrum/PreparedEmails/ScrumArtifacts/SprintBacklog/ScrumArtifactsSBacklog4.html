<h3>The Agile Scrum Artifacts - Sprint Backlog</h3>
<p>As new work is required, the Development Team adds it to the Sprint Backlog. As work is
    performed or completed, the estimated remaining work is updated. When elements of the plan
    are deemed unnecessary, they are removed. Only the Development Team can change its Sprint
    Backlog during a Sprint. The Sprint Backlog is a highly visible, real-time picture of the work that
    the Development Team plans to accomplish during the Sprint, and it belongs solely to the
    Development Team.</p>
