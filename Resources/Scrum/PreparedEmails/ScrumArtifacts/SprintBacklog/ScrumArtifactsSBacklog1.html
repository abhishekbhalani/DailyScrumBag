<h3>The Agile Scrum Artifacts - Sprint Backlog</h3>
<p>The Sprint Backlog is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus a plan for
    delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal. The Sprint Backlog is a forecast
    by the Development Team about what functionality will be in the next Increment and the work
    needed to deliver that functionality into a “Done” Increment.</p>
