<h3>The Agile Scrum Artifacts - Artifact Transparency</h3>
<p>Scrum relies on transparency. Decisions to optimize value and control risk are made based on
    the perceived state of the artifacts. To the extent that transparency is complete, these decisions
    have a sound basis. To the extent that the artifacts are incompletely transparent, these
    decisions can be flawed, value may diminish and risk may increase.</p>
