<h3>The Agile Scrum Artifacts - Artifact Transparency</h3>
<h4>Definition of "Done"</h4>
<p>When a Product Backlog item or an Increment is described as “Done”, everyone must
    understand what “Done” means. Although this may vary significantly per Scrum Team, members
    must have a shared understanding of what it means for work to be complete, to ensure
    transparency. This is the definition of “Done” for the Scrum Team and is used to assess when
    work is complete on the product Increment.
