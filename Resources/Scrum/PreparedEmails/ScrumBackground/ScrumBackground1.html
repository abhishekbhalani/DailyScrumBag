<h3>Agile Scrum Background</h3>
<p>Scrum is a process framework that has been used to manage work on complex products since
        the early 1990s. Scrum is not a process, technique, or definitive method. Rather, it is a
        framework within which you can employ various processes and techniques. Scrum makes clear
        the relative efficacy of your product management and work techniques so that you can
        continuously improve the product, the team, and the working environment.
