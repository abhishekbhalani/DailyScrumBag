<h3>The Product Owner</h3>
<p>The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. The Product Owner may represent the
    desires of a committee in the Product Backlog, but those wanting to change a Product Backlog
    item’s priority must address the Product Owner.</p>
<p>For the Product Owner to succeed, the entire organization must respect his or her decisions. The
    Product Owner’s decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the Product Backlog. No
    one can force the Development Team to work from a different set of requirements.</p>
