        <li>Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions</li>
        <li>Optimizing the value of the work the Development Team performs</li>
        <li>Ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what the Scrum Team will work
            on next</li>
        <li>Ensuring the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level needed
        </li>
    </ul>
