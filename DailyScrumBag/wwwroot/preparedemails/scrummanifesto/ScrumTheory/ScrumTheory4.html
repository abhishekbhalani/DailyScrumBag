<h3>Scrum Theory - Adaptation</h3>
<p>If an inspector determines that one or more aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits, and that the resulting
    product will be unacceptable, the process or the material being processed must be adjusted. An adjustment must be made
    as soon as possible to minimize further deviation.
</p>
<p>Scrum prescribes four formal events for inspection and adaptation. The
    <i>Scrum Events</i>:
    <ul>
        <li>Sprint Planning</li>
        <li>Daily Scrum</li>
        <li>Sprint Review</li>
        <li>Sprint Retrospective</li>
    </ul>
