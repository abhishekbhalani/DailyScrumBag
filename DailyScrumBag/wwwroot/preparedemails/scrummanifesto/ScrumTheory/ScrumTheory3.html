<h3>Scrum Theory - Inspection</h3>
<p>Scrum users must frequently inspect Scrum artifacts and progress toward a Sprint Goal to detect
        undesirable variances. Their inspection should not be so frequent that inspection gets in the way
        of the work. Inspections are most beneficial when diligently performed by skilled inspectors at
        the point of work.
