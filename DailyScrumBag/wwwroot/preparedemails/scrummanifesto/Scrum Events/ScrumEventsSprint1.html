<h3>The Agile Scrum Events - The Sprint</h3>
<p>The heart of Scrum is a Sprint, a time-box of one month or less during which a “Done”, useable,
    and potentially releasable product Increment is created. Sprints have consistent durations
    throughout a development effort. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the
    previous Sprint.</p>
