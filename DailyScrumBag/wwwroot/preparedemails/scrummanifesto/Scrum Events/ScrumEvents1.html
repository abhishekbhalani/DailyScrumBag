<h3>The Agile Scrum Events</h3>
<p>Prescribed events are used in Scrum to create regularity and to minimize the need for meetings
    not defined in Scrum. All events are time-boxed events, such that every event has a maximum
    duration. Once a Sprint begins, its duration is fixed and cannot be shortened or lengthened. The
    remaining events may end whenever the purpose of the event is achieved, ensuring an
    appropriate amount of time is spent without allowing waste in the process.</p>
