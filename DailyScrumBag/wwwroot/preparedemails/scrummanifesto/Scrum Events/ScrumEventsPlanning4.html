<h3>The Agile Scrum Events - Sprint Planning</h3>
<h4>Topic Two: How will the chosen work get done?</h4>
<p>Having set the Sprint Goal and selected the Product Backlog items for the Sprint, the
    Development Team decides how it will build this functionality into a “Done” product Increment
    during the Sprint. The Product Backlog items selected for this Sprint plus the plan for delivering
    them is called the Sprint Backlog.
    </p>
<p>The Development Team usually starts by designing the system and the work needed to convert
    the Product Backlog into a working product Increment. Work may be of varying size, or
    estimated effort. However, enough work is planned during Sprint Planning for the Development
    Team to forecast what it believes it can do in the upcoming Sprint. Work planned for the first
    days of the Sprint by the Development Team is decomposed by the end of this meeting, often to
    units of one day or less. The Development Team self-organizes to undertake the work in the
    Sprint Backlog, both during Sprint Planning and as needed throughout the Sprint.
