<h3>The Agile Scrum Events - Daily Scrum</h3>
<p>The structure of the meeting is set by the Development Team and can be conducted in different
    ways if it focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal. Some Development Teams will use
    questions, some will be more discussion based. Here is an example of what might be used:
<ul>
    <li>What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?</li>
    <li>What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?</li>
    <li>Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the
        Sprint Goal?</li>
</ul></p>
