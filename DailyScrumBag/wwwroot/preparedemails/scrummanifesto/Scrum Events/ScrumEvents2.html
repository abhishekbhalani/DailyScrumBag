<h3>The Agile Scrum Events</h3>
<p>Other than the Sprint itself, which is a container for all other events, each event in Scrum is a
    formal opportunity to inspect and adapt something. These events are specifically designed to
    enable critical transparency and inspection. Failure to include any of these events results in
    reduced transparency and is a lost opportunity to inspect and adapt.</p>
