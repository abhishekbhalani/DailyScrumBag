<h3>The Agile Scrum Events - Sprint Planning</h3>
<h4>Topic One: What can be done this Sprint?</h4>
<p>The number of items selected from the Product Backlog for the Sprint is solely up to the
    Development Team. Only the Development Team can assess what it can accomplish over the
    upcoming Sprint.</p>
<p>During Sprint Planning the Scrum Team also crafts a Sprint Goal. The Sprint Goal is an objective
    that will be met within the Sprint through the implementation of the Product Backlog, and it
    provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment</p>
