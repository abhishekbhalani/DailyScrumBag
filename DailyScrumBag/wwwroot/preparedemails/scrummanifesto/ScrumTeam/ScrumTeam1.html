<h3>The Agile Scrum Team</h3>
<p>The Scrum Team consists of:
    <ul>
        <li>Product Owner</li>
        <li>Development Team</li>
        <li>Scrum Master</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>Scrum Teams are self-organizing and cross-functional. Self-organizing teams choose how best to
    accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team. Cross-functional
    teams have all competencies needed to accomplish the work without depending on others not
    part of the team.</p>
