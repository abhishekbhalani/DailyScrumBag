<h3>The Agile Scrum Master</h3>
<p>The Scrum Master is responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum as defined in the Scrum
    Guide. Scrum Masters do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory, practices, rules,
    and values.</p>
<p>The Scrum Master is a servant-leader for the Scrum Team. The Scrum Master helps those
    outside the Scrum Team understand which of their interactions with the Scrum Team are helpful
    and which arenâ€™t. The Scrum Master helps everyone change these interactions to maximize the
    value created by the Scrum Team.</p>
