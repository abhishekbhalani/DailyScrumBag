<h3>The Agile Scrum Artifacts - Product Backlog</h3>
<p>A Product Backlog is never complete. The earliest development of it lays out the initially known
    and best-understood requirements. The Product Backlog evolves as the product and the
    environment in which it will be used evolves. The Product Backlog is dynamic; it constantly
    changes to identify what the product needs to be appropriate, competitive, and useful. If a
    product exists, its Product Backlog also exists.</p>
