<h3>The Agile Scrum Artifacts - Artifact Transparency</h3>
<h4>Definition of "Done"</h4>
<p>If "Done" for an increment is not a convention of the development organization, the
    Development Team of the Scrum Team must define a definition of “Done” appropriate for the
    product. If there are multiple Scrum Teams working on the system or product release, the
    Development Teams on all the Scrum Teams must mutually define the definition of “Done.”
