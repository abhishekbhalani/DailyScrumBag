<h3>The Agile Scrum Artifacts - Artifact Transparency</h3>
<h4>Definition of "Done"</h4>
<p>Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly tested, ensuring that all
    Increments work together.
    </p>
<p>As Scrum Teams mature, it is expected that their definitions of “Done” will expand to include
    more stringent criteria for higher quality. New definitions, as used, may uncover work to be
    done in previously “Done” increments. Any one product or system should have a definition of
    “Done” that is a standard for any work done on it.</p>
