<h3>The Agile Scrum Artifacts - Artifact Transparency</h3>
<p>The Scrum Master must work with the Product Owner, Development Team, and other involved
    parties to understand if the artifacts are completely transparent. There are practices for coping
    with incomplete transparency; the Scrum Master must help everyone apply the most
    appropriate practices in the absence of complete transparency. A Scrum Master can detect
    incomplete transparency by inspecting the artifacts, sensing patterns, listening closely to what is
    being said, and detecting differences between expected and real results. </p>
