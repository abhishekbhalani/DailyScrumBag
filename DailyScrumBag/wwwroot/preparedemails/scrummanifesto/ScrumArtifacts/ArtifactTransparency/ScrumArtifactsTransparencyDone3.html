<h3>The Agile Scrum Artifacts - Artifact Transparency</h3>
<h4>Definition of "Done"</h4>
<p>Development Teams deliver an Increment of product functionality every Sprint. This Increment
    is useable, so a Product Owner may choose to immediately release it. If the definition of "Done"
    for an increment is part of the conventions, standards or guidelines of the development
    organization, all Scrum Teams must follow it as a minimum.</p>
